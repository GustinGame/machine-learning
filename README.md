# This is an University project

This project was to make an simple site like an chat to interact with some artificial inteligence.
The main topic was to develop an simple assistant for someone with depression or axiety disorder to help them with some of the emmergency numbers in brazil for reaching it out if the conversation was in a bad mood or if the bot notice something that signify sadness.

## Process

The process was a lot harder that it seems, because make all the changes to the front-end(flutter) interact with the back end(fask-python) was a challenge to beat. But thanks to God, we could beat it, making this all work toguether the site and the api to interact with the input and print the outputs was a bit abstract at frist glance, but we did manage to solve it! There is some things we could improve at the final for presentation commit.

## Final Presentation

In the final presentation we did well, and the teacher with the effort give some points to Us, maijor of the people used chat-GPT as the api and builded the site. I was happy with the end result because all of it was made in 12 hours of project!!
